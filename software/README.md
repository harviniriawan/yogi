This holds the software files for yogi!

Currently, the folder holds example code taken from:
https://github.com/OttoDIY/DIY
http://www.instructables.com/id/Joy-Robot-Rob%C3%B4-Da-Alegria-Open-Source-3D-Printed-A/
https://github.com/shivasiddharth/GassistPi

I do not own any of the code from the above resources!
All code in example folders were taken directly from above sources.
They are meant to be included for easy reference and is meant to be removed during development.
PM me for removal.

Currently, own code in development:
